Here lies the code behind [cantphase.me](http://cantphase.me)

So far I've added the homepage ( One page scrollable site ), and I'm slowly working through the admin configuration screens, with items and Npcs almost done.

In the future my plans are to ( take this as a sorts of TODO, I'm going to try and address each one of these )
  * Create highscores
  * Create a private server wiki that updates automatically
  * Add forums (Quite likely a custom MyBB version )
  * A location for users to play the client live from the website
  * Donation area
  * Vote area
  * Download button actually working
  * Admin area
   * Implement a delayed heartbeat when the user is not looking at the page
   * Finish config modeling and make _ALL_ configs into Json
   * Live player management ( add items, remove items, change item statistics.. and so on )
    * A list of online players
     * Giving players items
     * Modifying user levels / xp
     * Kicking a player
     * Banning a player
     * Unbanning a player
     * Refreshing player configs to reload changes.
    * ~~A list of items currently available on the server~~
     * ~~Editing item statistics~~
     * Refreshing item configs to reload changes.
    * A list of NPCs currently configured for the server
   * Actual authentication for admin(s)
   * Item editor complete ( with item costs, and statistics )
   * Shop editor that takes inputs from items
   * Setting of global configs
   * And more...

In the distant nice to have future:
  * Possibly a set-up screen so people looking to deploy servers can do so easily???
  * Some sort of deploment mechanism that gets latest versions from git and updates in a "S.M.A.R.T" way
