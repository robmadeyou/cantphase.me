Here lies the code behind [cantphase.me](http://cantphase.me)

So far I've added the homepage ( One page scrollable site ), and I'm slowly working through the admin configuration screens.

In the future my plans are to
  * Create highscores
  * Create a private server wiki that updates automatically
  * Add forums (Quite likely a custom MyBB version )
  * A location for users to play the client live from the website
  * Donation area
  * Vote area

I'll have to somehow juggle both
