Let's be clear. When I say I, I usually mean we (robmadeyou and Neverlost)

Here lies my site... well the code of it anyway.

Currently the site is very early stages. I've added ways to log-in, sign-up and ported my other project [Homepage](http://github.com/robmadeyou/Homepage) to here. So far so good!



Made with the most amazing PHP framework in the world: [rhubarbphp](http://github.com/rhubarbphp/rhubarb)
and composed with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

This project is quite likely going to split off and become some sort of "media center"
for poeple, either on a Raspberry Pi's or personal computers, but for now; let's just have fun.
