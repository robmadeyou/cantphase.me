Here lies the code behind [cantphase.me](http://cantphase.me)

So far I've added the homepage ( One page scrollable site ), and I'm slowly working through the admin configuration screens.

In the future my plans are to ( take this as a sorts of TODO, I'm going to try and address each one of these )
  * Create highscores
  * Create a private server wiki that updates automatically
  * Add forums (Quite likely a custom MyBB version )
  * A location for users to play the client live from the website
  * Donation area
  * Vote area
  * Download button actually working
  * Admin area
   * Possibly a set-up screen so people looking to deploy servers can do so easily??? 
   * Actual authentication for admin(s)
   * Item editor complete ( with item costs, and statistics )
   * Shop editor that takes inputs from items
   * NPC editor ( with spawn locations, health etc )
   * Live player management ( add items, remove items, change item statistics.. and so on )
   * Some sort of deploment mechanism that gets latest versions from git and updates in a "S.M.A.R.T" way
   * And more...
